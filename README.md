# Implement Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Course assignment of implementing a Transmission Control Protocol based on UDP sockets. Please do not use this code for any purpose. The simplified version of protocol requires:

### Proper message format

### Transmission details

Requirements of maximum number of retransmissions, Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of IP packet.
#### Timeout Computation
Sender will always update the timestamp field in packet with current time. Receiver acked will copy the timestamp . After sender received the ACK it will compute the round trip time and we are calculating the timeout based on it.
#### Update Connection State
3-way handshake at start and termination. Update ACK number in packet when sending payload.

### Testing
```
java TCPend -p <port> -s <remote IP> -a <remote port> â€“f <file name> -m <mtu> -c <sws>
```
remote receiver
```
java TCPend -p <port> -m <mtu> -c <sws> -f <file name>
```
