Q2:  Predict latency: approximately the summation of latency in link L1, L2, L3
	Predict throughput: same as any throughput in Q1
	Measured RTT: 161.110ms
	Measured throughput: 59779 KB, rate=18.647 Mbps

Q3:  Predict RTT: Slightly larger than RTT in Q2 because of extra queueing delay time
	Predict throughput: smaller than throughput in Q2
	Measured Results:
h7-h9 h1-h4   RTT: 161.353ms, 161.326ms
			throughput: 48152kb, 14.060Mbps;   16572kb, 5.343Mbps
h7-h4 h1-h9   RTT: 161.429ms, 161.534ms
			throughput: 46797kb, 13.843Mbps;   15964kb, 5.135Mbps
h7-h9  h1-h10 RTT: 161.664ms, 161.455ms
			throughput: 49470kb, 14.321Mbps   14670kb, 4.569Mbps
h7-h4  h1-h10  RTT: 161.651ms, 160.805ms
			throughput: 51200kb, 15.416Mbps    12202kb, 3.889Mbps
	Conclusion: RTT has no big difference with Q2 because number of hosts working simultaneously is not large enough to affect queueing delay, which is similar with what we predicted. Measured throughput is different from what we predicted, this may be the result of not starting two pairs at the exact same time. We opened two xterm hosts and started them as close as to 0 delay, but this will still affect accuracy. Therefore, the throughput of the first started pair is higher than the second pair, and the throughput of the second pair is one third of throughput in Q2.

Q4:  Predict RTT: Approximately the same as RTT in Q2. Since we still only have 2 pairs sharing the link.
	Predict throughput: smaller than throughput in Q2
	According to measurement result, prediction is correct.
